        <h2>Fresh homemade pepperoni pizza</h2>
        
        <p>
            Who needs delivery when you can wip up an awesome<br>
            pizza in 25 minutes!<br><br>
            <strong>Note:</strong>To make this even easier, skip the homemade sauce<br>
            and use your favorite jarred pizza sauce instead.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li>16 ounces pizza dough, store-bought or homemade
                <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce, store-bought or homemade
                <li>18 to 20 slices pepperoni (or more!)
                <li>12 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
                <li>1 teaspoon fresh oregano, optional
                <li>Flour for rolling and shaping dough
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h4>For the Quick Pizza Sauce</h4>
                <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce (no salt)
                <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
                <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic
                <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated onion
                <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
                <li>1 teaspoon olive oil
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 500°F:

                <p>
                    If you are using a pizza stone, preheat it in the oven<br>
                    for at least 20 minutes so it is nice and hot as well
                </p>

                <li>Make the sauce:

                <p>
                    If you are using my sauce recipe, stir together the<br>
                    ingredients. The sauce recipe makes just enough for<br>
                    one large pizza. You can easily double it if you are<br>
                    making more than one pizza.
                </p>

                <li>Roll out the dough:

                <p>
                    Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface. If it's<br>
                    hard to roll, let it rest for 5 minutes so it can come<br>
                    to room temperature. For a large pizza, I like to roll<br>
                    my dough into about a 14-inch diameter circle.
                </p>


                <li>Add the toppings:

                <p>
                    Transfer the dough to a lightly dusted pizza peel.<br>
                    Alternatively, fit it into a large cast-iron.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Add sauce in a light layer all over the pizza, leaving<br>
                    about 1/4-inch crust around the edges. Chop half of the<br>
                    pepperoni and sprinkle it over the sauce. Top the pizza<br>
                    with grated cheese and the rest of the pepperoni. Season<br>
                    with black pepper.
                </p>

                <li>Cook the pizza:

                <p>
                    If you're using a pizza stone, carefully slide pizza into the<br>
                    center of the preheated pizza stone. Cook for 6 minutes, then<br>
                    rotate the pizza halfway so it cooks evenly. Cook for another<br>
                    6 to 8 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and charred<br>
                    in spots.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you're using a skillet, press the dough into a cast iron skillet<br>
                    and add toppings. Place the skillet over a high heat burner for<br>
                    2 minutes to get it preheated and get the crust cooking right away.<br>
                    Then transfer to a 500 °F oven and bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or<br>
                    until the crust is golden brown.
                </p>

                <li>Slice and serve:

                <p>
                    Use pizza peel to slide pizza out onto a cutting board. Let the pizza<br>
                    rest for a minute and slice into pieces. Season with fresh oregano<br>
                    (optional).<br>
                    
                    <p>Serve hot and enjoy! </p>
                </p>
