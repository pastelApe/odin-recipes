        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ground Beef</strong>: 
                Aim for an 80/20 blend of lean to fat for optimal flavor
            
            <li><strong>Hamburger Buns</strong>: Soft, sturdy buns like potato or brioche are ideal
            
            <li><strong>Cheese</strong>: American cheese slices melt well and are a classic choice 
            
            <li><strong>Salt and Pepper</strong>: Essential for seasoning the patties
            
            <li><strong>Toppings</strong> (Optional):
                <ul>
                    <li>Lettuce (shredded iceberg or leaf lettuce) 
                    <li>Tomato (sliced) 
                    <li>Onions (thinly sliced or diced) 
                    <li>Pickles (dill or sweet) 
                    <li>Ketchup and mustard 
                    <li>Burger sauce 
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Weigh beef into 2.5oz balls and keep them in the fridge all night.<br>
                Freeze the rest. 
            
            <li>Preheat a flat top grill or cast iron skillet to 575°F, check with infrared<br>
                thermometer. 
            
            <li>I let it ride for a few seconds, and then, using a very stiff 4" X 3" spatula,<br>
                smash! Don't smash straight down. Press the middle of the ball at a slight<br>
                angle away from you with the thicker side towards the middle. In a slight<br>
                smearing motion, spread the meat pretty hard into the pan. If all goes well,<br>
                and your pan is hot enough, the meat should stick to the pan and not your<br>
                spatula. Working quickly, go around the rest of the patty, smashing the edges<br>
                more than the middle. That is how you get those awesome lacy edges while<br>
                still having a bit of body to the burger.
            
            <li>Season the patty with a generous amount of salt and pepper.

            <li>Watch the edges and look for liquid coming up to the top. Once the edges look<br>
                browned on the bottom and cooked through, the center should still have a touch<br>
                of pink in it with lots of liquid rising to the top. 
            
            <li>Scrape hard and fairly quickly to get them to release and then flip.
                
            <li>Add cheese and cover with a lid, wait about 30 seconds to steam and melt. 
                
            <li>Transfer to prepared buns that have been toasted with butter. 
                
            <li>Dress with condiments and toppings of choice!

        </ol>
        
        <p>If I'm making a good bit of them, I keep them on a rack in a sheet pan in the oven<br>
           set to 200°F after they're assembled.</p>
        
        <p>And thats all it takes. Get ready to have the burger of a lifetime!</p>
